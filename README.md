# Noisy

Noisy is a Discord bot that uses OpenAIâ€™s Musenet to generate music on the fly. Listen with friends to a diverse set of 16 genres, ranging from Mozart to Lady Gaga. The goal is to create quality music for social situations, without needing to worry about playlists, URLs, or copyright infringements. Every song is unique and will only be played once.

## Feature Requests and Bug Reports

If you have any suggestions, we'd love to [hear your feedback](https://github.com/JonathanXu1/noisy-bot/issues/new/choose) and improve the bot to maximise happiness! Note: we're using Github issues, so you may need to create a Github account first before being able to fill feature requests and bug reports.

## How It Works

We generate new songs of a given genre by querying Musenet with the appropriate parameters. For each genre we store a list of available songs, and when the song currently being played is near the end of that list we query Musenet for new songs to add to the list. New songs are generated with beginnings identical to the endings of the most recent song in the given genre, so that we create relatively continuous sequences of songs which eventually diverge far from their starting points.

<!-- ## Local development

When running locally, make sure that the Heroku instance (production) is not running:

```
heroku ps:scale worker=0 -a noisy-bot
```

Now you can run the bot locally. To do so, you need to get the `.env` file from one of the project contributors. After, you can run the bot locally and it will be live on localhost:3002. The env file contains the bot token for Noisy-test. The token for production Noisy is on Heroku, and it is used by builds to Github master branch.

```
yarn
heroku local
```

Remember to bring the Heroku worker instance back up after local development:

```
heroku ps:scale worker=1 -a noisy-bot
``` -->
